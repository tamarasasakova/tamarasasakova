                    The Aarhus Dome of Visions,  located on Pier 2,  is one of many architectural experiments towards sustainable future.</p>

                    <h4 class="info-title">Inspiration</h4>
                    <p>The Dome of Visions in Aarhus opened in the autumn 2016. The project was designed by Kristoffer Tejlgaard, Copenhagen based architect, with the aim of creating functional, aesthetic and sustainable building. Using geometry and the knowledge of nature, creating an eviromentally friendly home, with less materials. The idea was inspired by Buckminister Fuller and Shoji Sadao, architects proposing a solution to save energy in 1960s NYC. Three kilometre geodesic dome over Manhattan.

                    <h4 class="info-title">Design and materials</h4>
                    <p>The geodetic dome is based on the strongest molecule structure nature has created, C60. The structure of a diamond.  It is using the least possible amount of resources to reach the maximal potential. The dome creates a shelter from wind and rain , therefore it is possible to build the actual house from just wood, avoiding any synthetic materials or chemicals eg. glue, silicon etc. “If you could digest wood, you could eat your house” they said. Materials such as wood store CO2, therefore it is a positive contribution to our future sustainable environment. </p>
