                <p> A Yurt is an traditional ancient home with its roots in Mongolia. A small, portable, eco-friendly living solution. They have been around for centuries and are coming back to life again. In fact in Aarhus as well.

                <h4 class="info-title">Design and materials 
                </h4>
                <p>Tradiotional Yurt has a circular shape. Usully with different “rooms” within called khana. All of the khanas are connected with leather ropes. The structure consists of many crisscrossed wooden  (willow, bamboo, poplar) poles. By using light wood the Yurts can be assembled and deassembeled in 30 minutes and are easily portable. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The structure itself is inspite of being from light wooden material very strong. It is because of the aerodynamic shape, which alows wind to flow around insted of ppushing against. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <h4 class="info-title">Symbolism</h4>
                <p> The Yurts have a long tradition in Asian culture, especially Mongolia. The yurt is not build randomly, every element is not only funcional but represents a part of the Mongolian culture. </p>
                    <br>
                <p>The yurt itself, traditionally called "gar", represents the universe, therefore it is circular, creating the illusion of infinity and speceiousness. </p>
                    <br>
                <p>The dome, also called "toonoo", is the rooftop of the gar. This part symbolizes the sky. In a sense the toonoo symbolizes a gate to the universe. </p>
