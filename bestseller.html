                <div class="info">
                    <p>One of the leading architecture firms in Denmark, C.F.Moller Architects have designed this elegant office building complex in the harbour of Aarhus. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The project started in 2009 and was finished in 2015. Bestseller consists of not one but multiple buildings, varied in size, function and placement. The whole building complex is connected by outdoor spaces, bridges, gardens and divided by fountains or canals running across the area. Described by architects themselves as “a mixture of office buildings and outdoor spaces which creates the impression of a town within a town.” </p>
                        <br>
                    <h4 class="info-title">Design and materials</h4>
                    <p>The south and north walls created from natural stone form distingtive ractangles around large blue windows. Implementing natural stone from Sicily on the north and south walls as well as natural stone on the west and east provided more sustainable solution as the architects tried to address raising enviromentall concerns. </p>
                        <br>
                    <h4 class="info-title">Green thinking</h4>
                    <p>The whole Bestseller complex is running on natural energy resources. Using solar energy to heat and nearby sea water to cool down the buildings, the complex has very low energy consumption, less than 50% of minimum requirements. 
                    </p>
                        <br>
                    <h4 class="info-title">Interior</h4>
                    <p>The indoor design and material follow the same principles. Natural stone which was used to create staircases is complemented by natural wood like oak. Indoor area also contains varios zones. We can find not only office spaces but also photo/film studio, showrooms and more. Below the buildings is a huge car park and bicycle storage racks, capable of spacing around 400 of both cars and bikes.</p>
